### Introductions

This repository is the home of Midi-chlorian, a compiler inspired by the mind of George Lucas. One of our team members had just finished five hours of reading Star Wars wiki articles, and proposed the name SkywalkerScript. After a bit of deliberation, our team settled on Midi-chlorian, named after the "intelligent microscopic life-forms that lived symbiotically inside the cells of all living things"[[1]](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Midi-chlorian).
