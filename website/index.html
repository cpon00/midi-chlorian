      <p>Midi-Chlorian, a language inspired by the mind of George Lucas.</p>
      <p>
        One of our team members had just finished five hours of reading Star
        Wars wiki articles, and proposed the name SkywalkerScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a bit of deliberation, our team settled on Midi-Chlorian, named
        after the "intelligent microscopic life-forms that lived symbiotically
        inside the cells of all living things".
